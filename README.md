# Introduction

Students across different campuses and universities already struggle with paying off their tuition, and yet, these institutions have the audacity to force
students to buy textbooks which can easily become very expensive. Our project is dedicated to providing alternative resources for textbooks, whether that be cheaper
websites or borrowing/buying books from other students who don't need them anymore.

This project is planned to become a trading service in which students can either post a book that they need, or sell/trade a book that they have. The purpose of 
this project is to provide alternate and accessible resources for students
